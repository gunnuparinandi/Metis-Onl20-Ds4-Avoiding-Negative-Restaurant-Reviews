Analysis from Yelp data on how to avoid negative restaurant reviews


This repository contains my analysis on ways to avoid negative restaurant reviews from the Yelp dataset.

The Yelp data was downloaded from https://www.yelp.com/dataset.

This repository contains four files:

1. Project 5 presentation 20201210.pdf is the final presentation.

2. Project 5 Final Submission.ipynb is the Jupyter notebook containing the code used in the analysis.

3. app.py is the python script containing the code to deploy the Streamlit App.

4. json_to_csv_converter.py is the python code to convert the reviews dataset from json to csv format. This was originally written by Scott Clark (https://github.com/Yelp/dataset-examples) for python 2. I updated the code for python 3.
